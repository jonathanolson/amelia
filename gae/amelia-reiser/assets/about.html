    <p>
        Amelia Reiser is an Atlanta based dancer, choreographer, and filmmaker. A
        native of Norman, Oklahoma, Amelia began dancing in the kitchen with her older
        sister just as soon as she could stand up. Her formal dance training began under
        the guidance of Julie Blacksten at the Classical Ballet Academy in 1991.
    </p>
    <p>
        Amelia continued to explore her passion for movement and has received a
        BFA in Dance from the University of Georgia. While at UGA, Amelia trained in
        aerial and contemporary dance with the CORE Concert Dance Company under
        the artistic direction of Bala Sarasvati. She also trained with the UGA Ballet
        Ensemble under the direction of Joan Buttram, performed and choreographed
        for the Young Choreographer’s Series and Senior Exit Concerts, and performed
        works by Rebecca Enghauser, Janet Robertson, and Daryl Foster in the Dance
        Reparatory Project Spring Concert 2011.
    </p>
    <p>
        In 2010-2011, Amelia worked with Diavolo Dance Theater and performed AWOL,
        and collaborated to create and perform Pandora’s Box as a part of Company B
        in Athens, GA. Amelia has expanded upon her dance training at various festivals
        including Bates Dance Festival and The American Dance Festival.
    </p>
    <p>
        In addition to creating and performing in live contemporary dance, Amelia
        is currently exploring the impact of dance on film; the environment editing
        can create with movement, and making site-specific work accessible to large
        audiences. Amelia has created numerous short dance films, both alone and
        collaboratively with other artists.
    </p>
    <p>
        Amelia’s work has been shown at various festivals including I.F. O.N.L.Y
        International Festival of a Necessarily Lonely You (Birr, Ireland) and AUX
        Experimental Arts Festival (Athens, GA). Her most recent collaboration with
        visual artist Lesley Wingfiled, a short underwater dance film titled Waters and the
        Wild (2012 Athlone, Ireland) has been shown at the Lightwell Gallery (Norman,
        OK) and at the Luan Gallery (Athlone, Ireland)
